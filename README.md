# PASSWORD-GENERATOR

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The purpose of this project is to show we can create a Quiz using javaScript. I created a Repository (Quiz-Yourself), cloned it to my computer, and step by step added in a README.md, index.html, script.js, and a style.css then added in the code from the Rutgers Repository.
In the script.js I will create the code needed to run the quiz.  More notes in the script.js file. I wanted to create a quiz that runs on javaScript can store information .
I wanted to utilize what I learned from the lessons to create this quiz.
quiz yourself on your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals! This quiz is timed, so there is a timer function. If you answer incorrectly, you'll lose time different parameters for scoring. If you answer correctly, you'll gain time. At the end of the quiz, you'll be able to save your score and compare it to others.
